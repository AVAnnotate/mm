The man I knew was very mellow, very thoughtful, very loving of me. Very happy to have me around, and very civil to her. So this was someone that I knew about, almost as that earlier part, almost as a legend. And you heard the stories before this. Oh, yeah. Oh, I mean yes, and they were told with such gusto, which was shocking to me, even as a child. Yeah, I mean, the I couldn't really laugh, I have to say, because I love my grandmother, and so in the telling of a story about her being chased by this wild man who was an alcoholic, I didn't understand that either. For many years he was an alcoholic, and alcoholism had actually come into our family through our Irish wine, the Irish, Scottish Irish drunkards, overseers, which is another story you know about just how you know you get certain traits in your family anyway.

I mean, you just hold them. And I actually taught this to a lover, and he loved it took him a long time to get it, but it's wonderful just to hold someone, just to, you know, come in, you're feeling like, you know, the end of the world, you've been harassed or fired or whatever.
