The clip of Ross Higgins' rendition appears below Bobby Pickett's performance for ease of comparison and to highlight the changes in meaning of the lyrics. Focusing on the lyrics about Dracula and his \"Transylvania twist\" highlight the cartoonish stereotypes of Dracula and his Transylvania heritage, parody and satire, and the shift to character comedy.
